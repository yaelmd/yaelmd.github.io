## Bio
I am a Bahamian researcher located in Vancouver, BC on unceeded xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) territory. I recently completed my MSc under the supervision of [Dr. Erin Bertrand](https://erinbertrand.wixsite.com/bertrandlab), which specialized in marine microbial ecophysiology. 

I’m currently an analyst and citizen developer for Statistics Canada’s Innovation SURGE team. As part of the SURGE team, I help internal clients to transition to open source tools and workflows for data science using R, Python, and Git.

When I’m not writing up a script, you can often find me cycling, cooking, or teaching. I’m passionate about getting young people excited about science and providing access to information, tools, and skills that spark scientific creativity.

**Interests:** Marine Ecology, Science Communication, Equity and Inclusivity, Climate Justice, Scientific Computing 


## Inquiries
If you have questions about my work or are interested in collaborating, feel free to [contact me](mailto:alburycatalina@dal.ca). I am always interested in discussing data science workshop offerings. 

## Mentorship
I am open to acting as a mentor to youth navigating a career in science when I have the capacity. If you are part of a group which has historically been excluded from STEM and are seeking a mentor, please [reach out via email](mailto:alburycatalina@dal.ca) with a short introduction about yourself.
