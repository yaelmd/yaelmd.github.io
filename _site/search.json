    "text": "Employment Equity: An Analysis of Distribution of Salary Ranges of Public Service of Canada Employees\n{code}\nCode used to webscrape and visualize employee salary data from the Government of Canada’s Treasury Board. Here we demonstrate systemic disadvantage in career progression amongst Black public servants which must be resolved with a strategic plan to identify structural and systemic barriers and improve retention and success to levels achieved by their non-racialized peers.\nMaking a Research Website with Github and Hugo\nA tutorial for making a personal research website with Github and Hugo.\nPlanet aRt\n{code}\nMy attempt at making some pretty things with the generative art package, aRtsy.\nThesis Word Cloud\n{code}\nA quick little repo containing a script I used to create a word cloud from my thesis. Here I make a visually appealing representation of the frequency of words used to tell the story of what I’ve been working on for the past two and a half years.\nCoding Nature\nA repository for a workshop for Black high school students in Nova Scotia (ages 13+). This workshop aims to inspire passion for nature and science, while giving an introduction to coding logic and data. The included exercises demonstrate how we can use programming as a tool to improve our understanding of the world around us.\nIntro to Coding for Sr. High\nCode for a 2-day introductory coding tutorial for Bahamian high school students at Forest Heights Academy."

    "text": "I am a Bahamian researcher located in Vancouver, BC on unceeded xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) territory. I recently completed my MSc under the supervision of Dr. Erin Bertrand, which specialized in marine microbial ecophysiology.\nI’m currently an analyst and citizen developer for Statistics Canada’s Innovation SURGE team. As part of the SURGE team, I help internal clients to transition to open source tools and workflows for data science using R, Python, and Git.\nWhen I’m not writing up a script, you can often find me cycling, cooking, or teaching. I’m passionate about getting young people excited about science and providing access to information, tools, and skills that spark scientific creativity.\nInterests: Marine Ecology, Science Communication, Equity and Inclusivity, Climate Justice, Scientific Computing\n\n\n\nIf you have questions about my work or are interested in collaborating, feel free to contact me. I am always interested in discussing data science workshop offerings.\n\n\n\nI am open to acting as a mentor to youth navigating a career in science when I have the capacity. If you are part of a group which has historically been excluded from STEM and are seeking a mentor, please reach out via email with a short introduction about yourself."
